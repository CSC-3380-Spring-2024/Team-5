# Team-5
## Deep Dive Descent
-endless procedurally generated rougelike following a deep sea diver traversing the deepest and darkest depths of the ocean


## How to run

-Download Godot 
(Make sure to select the version with C# support)
[LINK](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/)

-Clone the repo or download the zip file

-Import project to godot and select the .godot executable to run
(Would include the godot binary file in the repo, but it is too large. We would have to create a release.)

-should open the game, run the main menu scene to begin
(Assuming you don't change anything, pressing Run Project, or F5, should be sufficient)
